# Establishment of BME and MAGIC populations


Eight winter wheat lines ‘Event’ (A), ‘Format’ (B), ‘BAYP4535’ (C), ‘Potenzial’ (D), ‘Ambition’ (E), ‘Bussard’ (F), ‘Firl3565’ (G), and ‘Julius’ (H) were selected as founders of an eight-way MAGIC population based on the following criteria [^1]:
(i) variation for disease resistance, quality, and agronomic traits.
(ii) derivation from diverse breeding programs.
(iii) importance within the respective quality group.

All founders originated from wheat breeders in Germany except for the variety ‘Ambition’, which emerged from the Nordic Seed (Denmark) breeding program. To create F1 seed, one ear per plant was used in four two-way crosses (AB, CD, EF, and GH). Out of each of the four two-way crosses, one randomly selected F1 seed was raised and two ears per plant were further mated to four-way crosses. Out of 32 available four-way crosses, sixteen independent plants were selected and crossed, to obtain eight F1 populations that involved four reciprocal cross combinations.

The four eight-way crosses were further hybridized with the four reciprocal eight-way crosses to establish 16 eight-way intercross combinations (ABCDEFGH/EFGHABCD). The term ‘MAGIC group 1–16’, as used here in after, refers to these 16 subpopulations. The F1 seeds of BMWpop progressed to the F6 generation via single seed descent followed by two generations of bulk propagation in the field. The crossing procedure started in June 2009 and was completed in December 2010 followed by 5 years it took to self the plants to F6:8 recombinant inbred lines (RILs).
