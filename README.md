# Establishment of BMW and MAGIC populations


Eight winter wheat lines ‘Event’ (A), ‘Format’ (B), ‘BAYP4535’ (C), ‘Potenzial’ (D), ‘Ambition’ (E), ‘Bussard’ (F), ‘Firl3565’ (G), and ‘Julius’ (H) were selected as founders of an eight-way MAGIC population based on the following criteria [^1] :
[^1]: My reference.


(i) variation for disease resistance, quality, and agronomic traits.

(ii) derivation from diverse breeding programs.

(iii) importance within the respective quality group.

All founders originated from wheat breeders in Germany except for the variety ‘Ambition’, which emerged from the Nordic Seed (Denmark) breeding program. To create F1 seed, one ear per plant was used in four two-way crosses (AB, CD, EF, and GH). Out of each of the four two-way crosses, one randomly selected F1 seed was raised and two ears per plant were further mated to four-way crosses. Out of 32 available four-way crosses, sixteen independent plants were selected and crossed, to obtain eight F1 populations that involved four reciprocal cross combinations.

The four eight-way crosses were further hybridized with the four reciprocal eight-way crosses to establish 16 eight-way intercross combinations (ABCDEFGH/EFGHABCD). The term ‘MAGIC group 1–16’, as used here in after, refers to these 16 subpopulations. The F1 seeds of BMWpop progressed to the F6 generation via single seed descent followed by two generations of bulk propagation in the field. The crossing procedure started in June 2009 and was completed in December 2010 followed by 5 years it took to self the plants to F6:8 recombinant inbred lines (RILs).

# Multispectral 3D scanner for plant phenotyping (Phenospex, PlantEye F600)


PlantEye is a unique plant phenotyping sensor that combines 3D vision with multispectral imaging. This patented technique captures plants non-destructively and delivers precise and objective plant parameters on plant morphology and physiology. This tool fully automates the phenotyping process and creates insights into plant growth or changes in health [^2] :

# Data Collection

our experiment comprises two instances of harvest that were conducted at different time intervals. The first harvest was carried out precisely 21-30 days after the implementation of drought stress (BBCH 31). We aimed to determine whether the genotypes and CID groups exhibit identical characteristics under drought conditions. To achieve these, a total of 78 plants were carefully selected from the experimental setup and utilized for the measurement of various traits. These traits encompassed the assessment of fresh and dry biomass weight, fresh and dry leaves weight, Root/shoot ratio, as well as the determination of leaf water content (LWC).


the second harvest was carried out during the ripening stage of the plants, specifically at the BBCH 91-92 growth stage. The plants were utilized to measure certain traits manually, in parallel with the Phenospex device. In addition to this, several other traits were also measured and compared to the results obtained from the Phenospex device. These included traits such as dry biomass, maximum and average height, the weight of the ears, number of kernels, and thousand kernel weight (TKW). The main objective of this study was to ascertain whether there are any similarities between different Lines and CID (Carbon Isotope Discrimination) groups under both drought and control conditions.
