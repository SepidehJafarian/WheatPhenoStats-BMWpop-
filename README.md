# BMW_phenotyping

 In this section of the project, the 10 selected extreme lines regarding their CID mesearment, were planted into the green hoause.
 all selected lines were driven from the MAGIC population and they were chosen based on the high genetic diversity, to be the representative of their founders and preciesion of 
 their measurement for CID (2 replication)
 all growth parameters of the plants were measured using a multispecteral camera in the green hause (phenospex)
 The other desired traits such as the TKW, Dry Biomass, Max height, etc were measured manually
