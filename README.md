# BMW_phenotyping



[establishment of BMWpop and MAGIC population](###populations)
 - In this project section, the 10 selected extreme lines regarding their CID measurements, were planted into the pots in the greenhouse.

 
-  All selected lines were driven from the MAGIC population and chosen based on the high genetic diversity (to represent their founders) and the precision of 
   their measured CID (2 replications).

 
-  Several growth parameters of the plants were measured using a multispectral camera in the greenhouse (Phenospex).
  
-  The other desired traits such as the TKW, Dry Biomass, Max height, etc were measured manually.
